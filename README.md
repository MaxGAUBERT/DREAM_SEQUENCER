# DREAM_SEQUENCER

DREAM_SEQUENCER is a modular music production and sequencing application designed for intuitive pattern-based composition and live arrangement. It combines classic step sequencing workflows with modern editing tools to provide fluid control over rhythm, melody, and sound design.

---

## Core Concepts

DREAM_SEQUENCER is built around two main playback modes:

* **Pattern Mode** – Loop-based playback of individual patterns for precise sound design and experimentation.
* **Song Mode** – Linear arrangement by chaining multiple patterns inside the Playlist for full track composition.

---

## Main Features

### 🥁 DrumRack

A dedicated module for rhythm creation and sample playback.

* Load custom audio samples per channel
* Assign samples to tracks
* Trigger and play the currently selected pattern
* Real-time playback in Pattern Mode

The DrumRack acts as the rhythmic backbone of DREAM_SEQUENCER, allowing fast construction of beats and groove structures.

### 🎹 PianoRoll

An advanced note editor for melodic and harmonic content.

* Visual grid-based note editing
* Adjustable note length, velocity, and position
* Support for chromatic input
* Precise timing control
* Designed for synth lines, basses, and melodic patterns

The PianoRoll offers detailed control over pitch-based sequencing with an intuitive interface for musical expression.

---

### 🎛 FXChain

A flexible effects management system for sound shaping.

* Per-channel effects routing
* Real-time FX processing
* Chain multiple effects in sequence
* Volume control per channel
* Mix handling for dynamic balance

FXChain enables full control over sound design and audio processing within the sequencer environment.

---

### 🔊 Channel Volume Control

Each channel includes individual volume management for accurate mixing.

* Independent level adjustment
* Real-time feedback
* Balanced output for complex arrangements

This allows precise control of the overall mix directly from the interface.

---

### 🗂 PatternSelector

A pattern management system for fast musical navigation.

* Create and organize multiple patterns
* Switch patterns dynamically
* Visual pattern overview
* Pattern switching during playback

PatternSelector is the core tool for structuring musical ideas and transitioning between variations.

---

### 📜 Playlist (Song Mode)

The Playlist is used for arranging patterns into a complete song structure.

* Sequence patterns linearly
* Define playback order
* Enable Song Mode for full-track playback
* Visual timeline of pattern progression

This transforms individual patterns into a cohesive musical composition.

---

## Workflow Overview

1. Create drum and melodic content using DrumRack and PianoRoll
2. Apply audio processing via FXChain and adjust channel volumes
3. Organize and switch patterns through PatternSelector
4. Arrange patterns in the Playlist
5. Play the full composition in Song Mode

---

## Target Use Cases

* Electronic music production
* Beat making
* Live performance sequencing
* Sound experimentation
* Rapid music prototyping

---

## Project Status

DREAM_SEQUENCER is under active development and continuously evolving with new features and optimisations.

---

## Technologies
